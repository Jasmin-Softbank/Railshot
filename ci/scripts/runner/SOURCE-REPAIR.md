# Source repair in customer CI

The workflow and CLI default to one initial adapter invocation plus at most two
fixer invocations, with a hard cap of three SDK invocations. The existing operator
variable `RAILSHOT_MAX_REPAIR_ATTEMPTS` bounds fixers (`0|1|2`, default `2`), while
`RAILSHOT_MAX_PACKAGING_ATTEMPTS` bounds adapters (`0|1`, default `1`). Repair `0`
remains the explicit switch that disables all SDK work, including the adapter.
Out-of-range role limits are rejected before SDK setup. The workflow retains source scope
and the CLI retains packaging scope; the budget does not broaden either.
Repository variables override workflow fallbacks. Jev diagnostics run separately in the API
and do not enable the fixer or change the selected attempt budget.
Set the apps repository's `PLATFORM_REF` to the reviewed platform commit and
update its workflow from `ci/workflows/railshot-deploy.yml`. A saved run is bound
to its original harness and source; start a new request after changing these
bindings instead of resuming an old failed run with different rules.

Deployment requires the selected environment, exact app/image identity, a successful
build and real runtime/public access. Q quality results remain visible but missing
tests/checkers and completed lint/type/unit failures do not block release. Q
isolation, source snapshot, evidence-write, unknown execution and cleanup failures
still block. Publish the API validator update before emitting advisory artifacts.
Initial adaptation uses packaging scope; source scope is granted only after an
observed L2 build or L3 runtime failure. Do not generate tests, checker setup,
features or unrelated refactors for deployment.
The workflow also passes the registered `APP` as `--app-id`: the durable binding,
agent task and L1 check use that exact identity. A spec mismatch fails before
quality/build work and remains repairable as F5; publication checks it again.

An early failure starts a bounded proposal, not a pass. The model returns failure
evidence and file-level reasons. The runner derives the ordered `gate_plan` from
the active host profile (default **L0 → L1 → L2 → L3**), marks its owner as `host`,
and durably records `<role>-plan.json` before applying any bytes. The loop stores it as `<role>-<attempt>-plan.json`, checkpoints
it, and includes its hash, gate list and subsequent written files/verdict in
`evidence.json`. Workflow artifacts expose that safe linkage; source text and
raw model planning text remain in the private run directory. Every changed
attempt reruns the deterministic gates from L0. The loop supplies the configured
total attempt count.
The CLI uses `--max-attempts 0|1|2` for fixers and `--max-packaging-attempts 0|1`
for the initial adapter. Neither role may borrow the other role's unused slots:
an existing spec permits at most two fixer invocations even when the adapter is
unused. Packaging `0` disables model-based adaptation but keeps deterministic
packaging. Repair `0` runs only deterministic checks even when packaging is `1`,
without model credentials or SDK installation. A rejected adapter exhausts its
single slot and cannot switch roles to retry. Safe fixer replans consume fixer slots.
Rejected proposals consume the same role slots, and an unchanged failure signature stops
the run sooner. Completed checkpoints consume their original slots on resume;
changing either configured limit rejects the resume binding.

A completed model response rejected by schema or patch validation can consume a
remaining attempt for a fresh fixer plan only when the runner proves zero source
writes. Safe registered validation guidance is recorded in `rejection-N.json`
and the next failure context. Reference errors include a fixed reason and field
(e.g. `EVIDENCE_LINE_OUT_OF_RANGE`, `evidence_refs[0].line`) in the existing
`evidence.json` artifact. Host case/source/policy drift is not safe to replan.
Invalid/partial filesystem writes, authentication,
native policy failures and unknown execution outcomes never use this path.
Rejected attempts count toward the same limit, and checkpoint/resume does not
repeat the completed model call. A corrected proposal still reruns every gate.

| First failure | Authorized remediation | Required evidence afterward |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L0 prohibited patch | Revise proposal within unchanged platform limits | Full patch policy; scoped regular-text deletion only, no protected/escaped paths, secret files or bypasses |
| L1 missing/invalid Dockerfile or service spec | Generate the smallest packaging proposal | Schema, port, image and service contract |
| Q missing tests/checkers or completed lint/type/unit failure | Record the original result as advisory and continue; no model repair | Required build, scan and runtime checks still pass |
| Missing JS dependency lock / additive dependencies | Native npm/pnpm/Yarn resolution in existing filtered-network Docker sandbox | External hash-bound native lock receipt, then frozen install and full gates |
| L2 install/context/architecture error | Correct Dockerfile, build context, source or additive dependencies | Build succeeds under existing isolation and allowlisted base constraints |
| L4 fixed vulnerability | Correct the permitted base/package packaging | Scanner passes unchanged policy |
| L3 start, port, real health or source error | Correct source, command or deployment spec | Real app runtime and contract health checks pass |
| Runner, Docker, network/auth/secret absence, uncertain execution | Stop with the actual operator action | Infrastructure recovery evidence before a new execution |

The model retains read-only, network-disabled tools. It proposes at most eight
files and 20 KB per patch, including original bytes of deleted files. Creation/update uses the full content; deletion uses `action: delete` with empty content. File actions are recorded before applying them. Existing tests, scripts (except the exact npm empty-test
placeholder), dependency versions, checker configuration, migrations and schemas
are immutable. The underlying source validator accepts additive manifest test setup and exact
public package versions; it never accepts model-authored locks. Native locks have
a separate 4 MiB bound and must match both the recorded bytes and manifest.
The resolver uses the same non-root, capability-free, read-only source mount,
resource limits and approved network as quality execution. No credential,
Docker socket, host write, cluster or cloud permission is granted to the model.

The source validator has legacy additive test syntax support for explicitly reviewed
work, but the deployment task never asks a model to add tests or checker setup.
Existing tests and checker configuration remain protected. Q and L4 are NOT_RUN
unless included in the active profile. The default L3 health check proves only
startup/health behavior, never application business correctness.

Every file proposal must carry the exact case_id, case SHA-256, source digest,
policy digest and failure fingerprint. At proposal recording and again immediately
before applying bytes, the runner compares the immutable host case, current source,
active profile and protected policy. Source references must identify an existing
line with the exact file digest; log references must match captured redacted bytes.
Only structured `evidence_refs` are citations. Prose in `root_cause` and
`assumptions` remains unverified; host:port text is not a file reference. These
checks verify reference integrity, not the truth of a causal interpretation.
Missing evidence blocks writes. Gate execution still decides every outcome.

While a Codex call runs, native SDK events update content-free progress counters
in the existing private lifecycle receipt at most once per five seconds (plus a
terminal flush). These include item types/status, elapsed time, token counts and
the last SDK event time, never commands, responses or reasoning text. The loop
projects a run/attempt-bound snapshot to GitHub Actions stderr every 20 seconds
as `agent.heartbeat`; `sdk_activity_since_previous` and `last_sdk_event_age_ms`
distinguish new SDK activity from a live process waiting without new events.
`agent.observation` records the process return. These observations never imply
gate success. The trusted parent also publishes at most 60 recent safe events to
a `Railshot agent events` GitHub Check, bound to the source commit, workflow run,
run attempt, tenant, app and target. Its completion is neutral, not gate success.
`loop.started` and `loop.completed` include `agent_budget` with `enabled` and
`max_invocations` (`0`, `1`, `2` or `3`). The default declaration of three is not an
observed count. Final `sdk_invocations` counts only SDK invocations
established by receipts; an uncertain count remains null. Model requests within an
SDK invocation are separate. `evidence.json` retains the declared budget, while
`budget_used` records consumed supervisor slots by role. Deploy a reader accepting
the optional budget field with a maximum of three before promoting this workflow and runner. Older events
omit the field and must not be assigned an invented budget.
The job's short-lived `checks:write` token is removed from the environment before
child processes run; transport failure never changes the gate result or repeats
a model call. Private native logs retain the full history.

The session-owned `GET /api/v1/deployments/{id}/events` API verifies those bindings
and the GitHub Actions producer against the latest workflow attempt. The existing
dashboard work-log tab polls it with deployment status and displays content-free
SDK progress, delayed observations and missing records separately. An older
attempt is never used as fallback. Runs from before this transport was enabled
have no fabricated event history. The API's bounded 15-second cache and the
dashboard's 15-second polling can delay visibility beyond the 20-second producer
interval; this is progress observation, not a subsecond stream.

`test_source_repair.py` executes generated calculator tests with real Node,
demonstrates that a wrong arithmetic implementation fails, checks native npm lock
generation/receipt tampering, and tests every gate's repair decision and the
host's complete plan recording. Docker transport is mocked in those local checks. A real
customer workflow and deployment receipt are separate production evidence.
